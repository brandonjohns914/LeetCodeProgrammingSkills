//You are given two strings s and t.
//String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
//Return the letter that was added to t.

//Example 1:
//Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
//Output: "e"
//Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.

//Example 2:
//Input: s = "", t = "y"
//Output: "y"
